    // Plan of action.
    // I want to create a coronavirus simulator.
    // Set up github.
    // For speed I will start with 10 people.
    // Will have a variable sized box.
    // Will have a class for people.
    // The class will have variables like speed and position.
    // A possible idea is to also use age and use some stats to work out prob of death.
    // Then colour code age of people.
    // Then I need to use a GUI thing (see cairo bit) -- gtk.org/docs/language-bindings/cpp 
    // Our screen object will contain an array of people.
    // Want to set this up early to make debugging easier.
    // Want to give the people class a go to function.
    // This go to function should be able to do social distancing - i.e. if social_distancing then avoid people.
    //  Need to create walls in order to do quarantine.

    // Step zero:   Git.
    // Step one:    set up GUI (maybe requires a screen class).
    // Step two:    set up person class.
    // Step three:  test GUI.
    // Step four:   set up some useful functions.
